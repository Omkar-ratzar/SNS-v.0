# SNS-v.0
Download the setup file(SNS-v.0-setup.7z), install SNS and you'll be able to run it in your machine :D 
for development purposes, use the whole repo :p 

After installing SNS, open the listener on another machine in your network. Paste the IP address of that machine in your machine's SNS and you're ready to go!

Troubleshooting:
Before using SNS make sure you can atleast ping that machine through your device, if you can't then configure your firewall settings and try again, or check on youtube, how to ping another machine on local network :D
